## About The Project

![Screen Shot](download1.png)

The project's motivation was to predict the level of risk of clients based on the clients financial history, medical history of the family members, height, weight, BMI and several other factors like these. I designed an end-to-end data science modelling pipepline, starting from data cleaning, visualization, feature engineering to predictive modelling all combined in a jupyter notebook for ease of use. 

Firstly, I did extensive data cleaning and visualizations using libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and NumPy. I created a lot of count plots, point plots, and other graphs.

Secondly, I did some Feature Engineering and calculated feature importance with respect to several classifiers like Random Forest, XGBoost and Logistic Regression. I could identify the most important features involved in risk calculation.

Thirdly, I did hyperparameter tuning to find the best parameters for my model. The best parameters were then selected for all the three classifier.

I compared 4 models - Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, Max Voting and Stacked classifier out of which the Stacked classifier outperformed all the classifiers with an accuracy above 95%.
