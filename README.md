## About The Project

![Screen Shot](download.png)

The project's motivation was to detect financial credit card transaction fraud on a dataset with around 1 million transactions listed. I designed an end-to-end data pipeline for this project. 

Firstly, I did extensive data analytics using libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and NumPy. I created a lot of count plots, point plots, and other graphs.

Secondly, I did some Feature Engineering using a Dimensionality Reduction technique called PCA. Cleaning and imputing missing values was also a part of this stage.

Thirdly, I did hyperparameter tuning to find the best parameters for my model. The best parameters were then selected for modelling XGBoost. 

Lastly, I could identify the most important features involved in fraudulent transactions.
